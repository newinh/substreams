Integrating Substreams can be quick and easy. This guide will help you get started with consuming ready-made Substreams packages or developing your own. Substreams are permissionless. Grab a key [here](https://thegraph.market/), no personal information required, and start streaming on-chain data.

# Build

## Explore Available Substreams Packages

There are many ready-to-use Substreams packages available. You can explore these packages using the [**Substreams Registry**](https://substreams.dev). The registry lets you search for and find packages that meet your needs.

Once you find a package that fits your needs, you can choose how you want to consume the data:
- **[SQL Database](../how-to-guides/sinks/sql/sql-sink.md)**: Send the data to a database.
- **[Subgraph](../how-to-guides/sinks/subgraph/subgraph.md)**: Configure an API to meet your data needs and host it on The Graph Network.
- **[Direct Streaming](../how-to-guides/sinks/stream/stream.md)**: Stream data directly to your application.
- **[PubSub](../how-to-guides/sinks/pubsub.md)**: Send data to a PubSub topic.

## Optionally Develop Your Own Substreams

If you can't find a Substreams package that meets your specific needs, you can develop your own. Substreams are built with Rust, so youâ€™ll write functions that extract and filter the data you need from the blockchain. The easiest way to get started is by referring to the [tutorial](../tutorials/intro-to-tutorials.md) section, enabling you to quickly filter data: 

- [EVM](../tutorials/evm.md)
- [Solana](../tutorials/solana.md)
- [Starknet](../tutorials/starknet.md)
- [Injective](../tutorials/cosmos-compatible/injective.md)
- [MANTRA](../tutorials/cosmos-compatible/mantra.md)

To build and optimize your Substreams from zero, use the minimal path within the [Dev Container](../references/devcontainer-ref.md) to setup your environment and follow the [How-To Guides](../how-to-guides/develop-your-own-substreams/develop-your-own-substreams.md).

## Learn

- **Substreams Reliability Guarantees**: With a simple reconnection policy, Substreams guarantees you'll [Never Miss Data](../references/reliability-guarantees.md).
- **Substreams Architecture**: For a deeper understanding of how Substreams works, explore the [architectural overview](../references/architecture.md) of the data service.
- **Supported Networks**: Check-out which endpoints are supported [here](../references/chains-and-endpoints.md).
