Once you find a package that fits your needs, you can choose how you want to consume the data:
- [SQL Database](./sql/sql-sink.md): Send the data to a database.
- [Subgraph](./subgraph/subgraph.md): Configure an API to meet your data needs and host it on The Graph Network.
- [Direct Streaming](./stream/stream.md): Stream data directly from your application.
